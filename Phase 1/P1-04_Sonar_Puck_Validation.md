PHASE ONE – UNDER-ICE SONAR PUCK VALIDATION

Program Document: P1-04

1.0 Purpose

Validate the sonar puck’s ability to classify:

Static planar reflectors

Distributed scatterers

Basic motion within depth bands

And map these into a binary depth grid.

2.0 Analytic Tasks (Doable Now)
2.1 Classification Scheme

Define:

Depth bins

Bit patterns

State categories

2.2 Power Budget

Estimate:

Ping energy

Listening window

Packet formation energy

3.0 Bench Tests (Required)

Phase One Experimental Requirement

Tank tests with reflectors and moving targets

Validate classification logic with fixed thresholds

4.0 Success Conditions

Distinct echo profiles for defined states

Puck can classify states using deterministic logic
