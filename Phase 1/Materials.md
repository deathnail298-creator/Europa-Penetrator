PHASE ONE – MATERIALS SELECTION CRITERIA

Program Document: P1-02

1.0 Purpose

Define a preliminary material palette for:

High-mass impact head

Melt nose

Mid-body shell

Tail section

Internal potting and protective structures

This does not select final alloys; it establishes criteria.

2.0 Material Categories
2.1 Impact Head

Requirements:

High toughness

High compressive strength

Cryogenic stability

Candidate classes: high-strength steels, ultra-tough alloys.

2.2 Melt Nose

Requirements:

High thermal conductivity

High-temperature tolerance

Compatibility with RCB heating

Candidate classes: high-temp metals/ceramics.

3.0 Test Requirements

Phase One Experimental Requirement

Testing required:

Cryogenic cycling

Thermal conductivity verification

Shock survivability

Outgassing/contamination tests

4.0 Success Conditions

Material palette consistent with mission constraints

No identified incompatibilities for cryogenic impact or melt operations
