PHASE ONE – ACOUSTIC RELAY CHAIN VALIDATION

Program Document: P1-03

1.0 Purpose

Determine feasibility of a frozen acoustic relay chain providing reliable 1-bit transmission through ice.

2.0 Analytic Tasks (Doable Now)
2.1 Acoustic Link Budget

Model:

Attenuation per meter

Sensitivity thresholds

Maximum bead spacing

2.2 Relay Chain Simulation

Simulate:

Per-hop BER

End-to-end BER

Packet repetition effectiveness

3.0 Bench Tests (Required)

Phase One Experimental Requirement

Freeze beads in stacked ice columns

Measure attenuation and BER at various distances

Validate 3-state logic behavior (0 / 1 / silence)

4.0 Success Conditions

Bead spacing ≥ 5–10 meters with acceptable BER

Relay chain reliability ≥ 90% with repetition
