PHASE ONE – RADIO LINK VALIDATION

Program Document: P1-06

1.0 Purpose

Demonstrate that a simple, low-gain mast antenna can occasionally transmit small packets off Europa’s surface.

2.0 Analytic Tasks (Doable Now)

Preliminary link budget

Path-loss envelope

Required repetition schedule

Acceptable packet loss percentages

3.0 Bench Tests (Optional but Recommended)

Low-power transmitter tests in air with attenuators

Mast buffer logic validation

4.0 Success Conditions

RF link not ruled out by first-order physics

Mast logic remains simple and deterministic
