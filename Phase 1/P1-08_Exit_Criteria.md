PHASE ONE – EXIT & KILL CRITERIA

Program Document: P1-08

1.0 Red-Flag Failure Modes

Any of the following terminates or redesigns the program:

Melt-tube collapses too fast for bead deployment

Acoustic attenuation requires bead spacing < 2–3 m

Sonar puck fails to classify defined states

Energy budgets produce mission life < 7 days

RF link cannot close even with repetition

2.0 Phase One Success Requirements

Phase One succeeds if:

Melt-tube, impact, and refreeze behavior remain plausible

Acoustic chain works at bench scale

Classification logic works in simple tank tests

Data and RF budgets close with margin

Integrated mission model supports meaningful science return
