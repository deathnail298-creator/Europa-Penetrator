PHASE ONE – VALIDATION & PRE-PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

Europa Penetrator Architecture
Program Document: P1-00

1.0 Purpose

Phase One establishes whether the Europa Penetrator architecture defined in Phase Zero is physically and operationally plausible enough to justify hardware prototyping, benchtop experiments, and future mission-class investment.

This phase does not build flight hardware.
It delivers:

Analytical models

Bench-scale experimental plans

Preliminary parameter bounds

Subsystem validation paths

System-level feasibility envelope

Formal exit/success criteria

Anything requiring additional testing is explicitly labeled Phase One Experimental Requirement.

2.0 Phase One Objectives

Phase One must:

Validate the impact + melt-tube concept at analytic and bench scale.

Establish criteria and preliminary models for the materials stack-up.

Demonstrate feasibility of the acoustic relay chain at low bit rates.

Define and test the sonar puck’s classification logic in controlled environments.

Validate the data path and bit budget from puck → bead chain → mast → Earth.

Produce a minimal but physically consistent RF link budget.

Develop a coherent energy and duty-cycle envelope for mission operations.

Identify red-flag failure modes that would kill the program early.

3.0 Scope

Included in Phase One:

Analytical modeling (impact forces, melt rate, attenuation, duty cycles)

Benchtop test definitions for melt behavior, acoustic signaling, sonar classification

Simplified simulations of data flow and packet reliability

Materials selection criteria and test matrices

RF and energy budget envelopes

Not included:

High-fidelity CFD or FEA

Radiation-hard electronics design

Launch/trajectory planning

Europan environmental certification

Flight system manufacturing

4.0 Phase One Deliverables

Each subsystem has its own P1 document:

P1-01 Impact & Melt-Tube Validation

P1-02 Materials Selection Criteria

P1-03 Acoustic Relay Beads Validation

P1-04 Sonar Puck Validation

P1-05 Data Path & Bit Budget

P1-06 Radio Link Validation

P1-07 System Energy & Duty Cycle

P1-08 Exit Criteria

5.0 Phase One Completion

Phase One is complete when:

All analytic models are consistent

All experimental requirements are defined

No subsystem has failed a feasibility threshold

The integrated architecture remains physically plausible

If any subsystem crosses a red-flag threshold, the program terminates or redesigns.
