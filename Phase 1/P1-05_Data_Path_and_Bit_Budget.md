puck → relay beads → surface mast → Earth

2.0 Analytic Tasks (Doable Now)
2.1 Packet Structure

Implement:

Start pattern

Header

Payload

End pattern

2.2 Relay Chain Simulation

Simulate:

BER per hop

Repetition strategies

Packet drop rates

Effective packet throughput

3.0 Success Conditions

Packet integrity achievable with realistic repetition

Data throughput supports scientifically meaningful cadence
