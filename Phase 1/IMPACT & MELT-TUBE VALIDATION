PHASE ONE – IMPACT & MELT-TUBE VALIDATION

Program Document: P1-01

1.0 Purpose

Evaluate the feasibility of:

Surviving surface impact

Establishing a downward melt-tube

Maintaining a temporary melt cavity for bead deployment

This establishes whether the architecture’s core mechanism is physically achievable.

2.0 Analytic Tasks (Doable Now)
2.1 Impact Energy & Deceleration

Model:

Penetrator mass range (25–120 kg)

Impact velocities (150–350 m/s)

Expected deceleration forces

Survivability of potted electronics

Tools: rigid-body impact equations, ice compressive strength datasets.

2.2 Melt-Tube Power Balance

Model:

Required melt power density (W/cm²)

Melt rate (cm/min)

Tube diameter (cm)

Refreeze time constants

Assumptions explicitly documented in a spreadsheet.

3.0 Experimental Tasks (Required)

Phase One Experimental Requirement

Heated penetrator analog tests in terrestrial ice columns

Shock/impact tests for electronics survival

Refrozen sleeve characterization (thickness, attenuation, structural integrity)

4.0 Phase One Success Conditions

Melt-tube persists long enough for bead drop

Deceleration survivable with off-the-shelf potting approaches

Melt rates and power density fall within realistic thermal budgets
