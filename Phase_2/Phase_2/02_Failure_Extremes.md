Failure Extremes
Purpose

This document explores worst-case failure behavior of the concept under extreme but plausible conditions.

The goal is not to catalog likely failures.
The goal is to understand how bad failure can become, how visible it is, and how far consequences propagate.

No mitigation, redesign, or corrective actions are proposed.

Failure Framing Rules

Failure is evaluated along four axes:

Severity — how damaging the failure is

Visibility — how noticeable the failure becomes

Propagation — whether failure spreads beyond the system

Persistence — how long failure effects last

A failure extreme is defined as a case where two or more axes escalate simultaneously.

Extreme Class 1 — Silent Non-Function
Description

The system remains physically present but provides no meaningful effect.

Extreme Behavior

Degradation reduces effectiveness below detection

Output blends into environmental noise

Failure is indistinguishable from normal background

Consequences

False confidence persists indefinitely

Decisions are made assuming protection or benefit exists

Failure is discovered only after downstream damage

This is a high-risk failure mode precisely because it is quiet.

Extreme Class 2 — Visible Degradation Without Collapse
Description

The system degrades in a way that is observable but not catastrophic.

Extreme Behavior

Performance decays unevenly

Physical wear becomes noticeable

Behavior drifts outside expected bounds

Consequences

Operator trust erodes

Questions arise about certification and oversight

The system begins to attract attention it was designed to avoid

The failure is not damaging — but it is no longer ignorable.

Extreme Class 3 — Secondary Harm Introduction
Description

Failure produces effects worse than having no system at all.

Extreme Behavior

Degraded components interact with surroundings

Local conditions worsen relative to baseline

Nearby assets experience increased stress

Consequences

The system becomes a liability

Removal or isolation becomes necessary

Responsibility shifts from passive neglect to active management

This extreme invalidates the infrastructure premise.

Extreme Class 4 — Failure Cascades
Description

A localized failure triggers failures in adjacent systems.

Extreme Behavior

Environmental interactions propagate

Maintenance actions introduce new risks

Small failures amplify through coupling

Consequences

Risk profile expands beyond original scope

Certification and review burdens multiply

Mission-level risk attribution changes

At this point, failure is no longer local.

Extreme Class 5 — Human-Driven Failure Amplification
Description

Human response to failure makes outcomes worse.

Extreme Behavior

Operators intervene unnecessarily

Ad-hoc procedures are introduced

Curiosity or concern drives interaction

Consequences

Human error compounds technical failure

Operational simplicity collapses

The system becomes a recurring discussion item

This extreme is common and often underestimated.

Extreme Class 6 — Long-Tail Catastrophic Interaction
Description

Rare combinations of conditions produce disproportionate outcomes.

Extreme Behavior

Unanticipated alignment of factors

Extreme events dominate lifetime behavior

Statistical assumptions fail

Consequences

Post-incident analysis reveals conceptual blind spots

Confidence in similar systems is damaged

Institutional memory overcorrects

Even if extremely rare, these failures shape policy.

Comparative Severity Note

The most dangerous failure extremes are not dramatic collapses.

They are:

Silent non-function

Gradual visibility increase

Human-amplified responses

These erode trust without providing clear failure signals.

Phase Boundary Signal

If failure extremes:

Are difficult to detect, and

Become visible only after damage, and

Invite human intervention

Then the concept violates the assumptions required for passive infrastructure.

Such concepts should not proceed without reframing.

This document does not decide that outcome.
It only identifies the edge.

Plain-English Summary

This document looks at how bad failure can get when things go wrong in the worst plausible ways. The most dangerous failures are not explosions or collapses—they’re quiet failures that persist, attract attention, or make people interfere. Phase 2 exists to surface those risks before execution ever begins.
