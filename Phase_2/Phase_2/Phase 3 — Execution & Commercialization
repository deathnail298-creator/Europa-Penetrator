Phase 3 — Execution & Commercialization
Purpose

Phase 3 defines execution rights, commercialization boundaries, and payment obligations.

Nothing in Phase 0, Phase 1, or Phase 2 authorizes execution.
Phase 3 is the only phase where real-world use is permitted.

If it touches reality, this phase governs it.

What Phase 3 Is

Phase 3 exists to:

Authorize execution under license

Define what constitutes commercialization

Define what does not constitute commercialization

Establish clean legal and financial boundaries

Protect both the licensor and the licensee

Phase 3 is intentionally narrow and explicit.

Execution Authorization

Execution of any kind requires:

A valid Phase 3 Execution License

Written authorization from the licensor

Agreement to Phase 3 terms

Execution without a Phase 3 license is a violation, regardless of intent.

Definition: Execution

Execution includes, but is not limited to:

Building or prototyping

Laboratory or field testing

Simulation intended to support real-world use

Manufacturing

Deployment

Integration into other systems

Use in proposals, grants, bids, or contracts

Government or commercial use

If it is done to move toward real-world use, it is execution.

Definition: Commercialization

Commercialization occurs when execution is connected to value creation, value capture, or institutional use.

Commercialization includes:

Sale of products or systems

Sale of services based on the system

Internal operational use by a for-profit entity

Use in government programs, contracts, or procurements

Inclusion in paid proposals, bids, or grants

Use that reduces internal costs, risk, or labor for an organization

Use as part of a bundled commercial offering

Profit is not required.
Organizational benefit is sufficient.

Definition: Non-Commercial Use

The following are explicitly not commercialization, provided no execution occurs:

Reading or reviewing materials

Internal discussion or critique

Academic analysis or commentary

Classroom teaching or academic papers

Conceptual comparison at a high level

Media discussion without implementation

Non-commercial use ends immediately when execution begins.

Edge Case Clarification

The following are still commercialization:

“Internal only” use at a company

“Pilot,” “trial,” or “evaluation” deployments

Use without direct revenue

Cost-avoidance or risk-reduction applications

Government use without resale

The following are not commercialization by themselves:

Independent re-derivation without use of protected materials

Pure theory discussion with no execution

Referencing ideas without application

Outcome controls, not labels.

License Structure (Summary)

Phase 3 Execution License is required before execution

License fee and scope are defined at time of agreement

Additional terms (royalties, exclusivity, field limits) are negotiated separately

No implied rights are granted

Possession of earlier phase materials grants zero execution rights.

Risk Allocation

Under Phase 3:

Execution risk belongs to the licensee

Performance is not guaranteed

No warranties are provided

Phase 2 analysis does not promise feasibility

Phase 3 authorizes action, not success.

Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0: Concept framing only

Phase 1: Test framing only

Phase 2: Theory only

Phase 3: Execution and commercialization only

Each phase is legally independent.

Enforcement Principle

If there is uncertainty about whether an activity constitutes commercialization, it does.

Clarification should be obtained before proceeding, not after.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 3 is the only phase that allows real-world use. If an organization builds, tests, deploys, proposes, or uses the system in any way that creates value or reduces cost, that counts as commercialization and requires a Phase 3 license. Reading and thinking are free; doing things is not.
