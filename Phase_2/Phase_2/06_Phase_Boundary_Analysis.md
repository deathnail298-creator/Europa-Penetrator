Phase Boundary Analysis
Purpose

This document defines the hard boundary between Phase 2 (theory exploration) and any subsequent phase.

Its purpose is to prevent accidental execution, scope creep, or retroactive reinterpretation of theory work as implementation guidance.

This file is the exit gate for Phase 2.

Phase 2 Completion Condition

Phase 2 is complete when:

Core assumptions have been stress-tested

Failure extremes have been identified

Constraint violations are understood

Archetypal context is established

Long-tail risks are surfaced

Phase 2 completion does not imply readiness to build.

It implies readiness to decide whether building is even appropriate.

Phase Separation Rule

Phase 2 answers questions of the form:

What does this idea depend on?

Where does it fail?

What breaks first?

What cannot be violated?

What kind of system is this, really?

Phase 2 does not answer:

How should it be built?

What should be optimized?

What materials should be used?

What tests should be run?

Answering those questions is execution.

Boundary Indicators

Crossing from Phase 2 into execution occurs when any of the following appear:

Dimensional specifications

Material or component selection

Performance targets or tuning

Cost models tied to fabrication or deployment

Test or validation planning

Operational procedures

Simulation intended to support real-world use

The presence of any one indicator is sufficient.

Permissible Outputs at Phase 2 End

At the conclusion of Phase 2, permissible outputs are limited to:

Lists of unresolved questions

Identified unknowns and uncertainties

Clear articulation of non-negotiable constraints

Explicit statements of what Phase 2 cannot answer

Decision-support framing only

No output may shorten the path to execution.

Misinterpretation Risks

Common boundary failures include:

Treating analytical clarity as readiness

Treating absence of red flags as validation

Using theory documents as proposal attachments

Translating reasoning directly into requirements

These failures are procedural, not technical.

Authority and Ownership

Phase 2 materials:

Do not authorize execution

Do not imply endorsement

Do not allocate responsibility

Do not assign ownership

Execution authority exists only outside Phase 2 under separate license and agreement.

Phase Transition Gate

Transitioning beyond Phase 2 requires:

Explicit intent to execute

Acceptance of execution risk by a responsible party

Separate licensing and authorization

Willingness to invalidate Phase 2 assumptions

Phase 2 remains intact even if execution later proves it wrong.

Legal and Interpretive Notice

Phase 2 documents are theory-only artifacts.

They are not:

Specifications

Designs

Instructions

Plans

Any attempt to treat them as such constitutes misuse.

Phase 2 Closure Statement

With this document, Phase 2 is considered complete.

No further analysis can occur within Phase 2 without violating its scope.

Any additional work must either:

Remain purely referential, or

Move explicitly into a different phase under different rules

Plain-English Summary

This document marks the end of Phase 2. Everything up to this point was about understanding limits, risks, and assumptions—not about building anything. If the next step involves making, testing, or deploying something, Phase 2 is over and a new phase has begun by definition.
