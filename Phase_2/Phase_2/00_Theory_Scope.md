Phase 2 — Theory Scope
Purpose of This File

This document defines exactly what Phase 2 covers and what it explicitly does not.

If a question comes up later about whether something “counts” as execution, this file is the reference. If it’s not allowed here, it belongs in Phase 3 or not at all.

Phase 2 Mission

Phase 2 exists to explore reasoning space, not solution space.

Its purpose is to:

Examine assumptions under stress

Identify failure extremes and edge cases

Explore constraint violations

Compare conceptual archetypes

Surface long-tail and non-obvious risks

Clarify where Phase 1 ends and execution begins

No outcome of Phase 2 is allowed to directly produce a buildable artifact.

In-Scope Activities (Allowed)

The following activities are explicitly within Phase 2 scope:

Conceptual reasoning and thought experiments

Worst-case and edge-condition analysis

Logical consistency checks

Failure tree exploration (theoretical only)

Assumption sensitivity analysis

Qualitative comparisons between architectures

Identification of unknowns and irreducible risks

Phase boundary clarification

These activities may produce insight, but not instructions.

Out-of-Scope Activities (Prohibited)

The following are explicitly excluded from Phase 2:

Design finalization

Dimensional specification

Materials selection for execution

Performance tuning or optimization

Simulation intended to support implementation

Cost modeling tied to manufacturing or deployment

Test planning

Validation planning

Operational concepts intended for execution

If it shortens the path to building something, it does not belong here.

Execution Boundary Rule

Phase 2 content must never answer the question:

“How would I actually do this?”

If a reasonable engineer could directly build, test, simulate, or propose based on the output, the boundary has been crossed.

Phase 2 answers why, what breaks, and what matters — not how.

Relationship to Other Phase 2 Documents

All other Phase 2 documents operate inside this scope:

Assumption stress tests explore fragility, not fixes

Failure extremes explore collapse modes, not recovery designs

Constraint violations explore impossibility, not workarounds

Comparative archetypes explore trade space, not selection

Long-tail risks surface uncertainty, not mitigation plans

Phase boundary analysis defines handoff points only

Any document that drifts outside this scope is invalid by definition.

Enforcement Principle

If there is ambiguity, interpretation defaults to non-execution.

When in doubt:

Remove detail

Generalize language

Shift from prescriptive to descriptive

Push content forward to Phase 3

Phase purity matters more than completeness.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is a thinking phase, not a doing phase. It exists to explore assumptions, failures, and limits without producing anything that can be built or executed. If content starts to look actionable, it no longer belongs here.
