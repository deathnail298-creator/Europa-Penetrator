Phase 3 — Technical Interpretation & Concept Fidelity
Purpose

This Phase 3 provision exists to prevent concept drift during early execution planning.

It does not provide engineering services, design work, specifications, or implementation guidance.

Its sole purpose is to ensure that any party intending to execute the concept understands what the concept is — and what it is not — before committing capital.

Why Concept Drift Is a Material Risk for This Project

This project is vulnerable to drift because:

It appears mechanically simple

It invites “improvements” that undermine its premise

It will attract well-intentioned optimization

It sits at the boundary between infrastructure, science, and mission hardware

Most failure modes for this class of system occur before hardware exists, when interpretation quietly mutates.

Definition: Concept Drift

Concept drift occurs when execution planning alters the fundamental character of the system while still using its name, rationale, or justification.

Examples include (non-exhaustive):

Introducing active control where passivity is core

Adding sensing, autonomy, or feedback that changes failure behavior

Optimizing for performance in ways that destroy robustness

Treating a sacrificial or single-purpose system as reusable

Expanding scope beyond what the original theory supports

Concept drift is often invisible until late-stage failure.

Phase 3 Technical Support — What Is Included

Under a Phase 3 Execution License, the licensor may provide technical interpretation support, limited to:

Confirming whether an execution interpretation aligns with the original concept

Identifying violations of non-negotiable constraints

Flagging category errors (e.g., treating infrastructure as active systems)

Highlighting where proposed framing invalidates Phase 2 assumptions

Pointing out where added complexity destroys intended failure behavior

This support is evaluative, not constructive.

It answers:

“Does this still match the idea?”

Not:

“How should we build it?”

What This Support Explicitly Does Not Include

The following are not included under any Phase 3 technical interaction:

Design reviews

Architecture development

Specification writing

Performance targets or tuning

Test planning

Materials or component selection

Simulation or modeling

Operational procedures

If an activity meaningfully advances implementation, it is execution and outside this scope.

Why This Has Real Technical Value

Preventing concept drift:

Avoids spending money on invalid designs

Prevents late-stage rework

Preserves original failure tolerance

Keeps certification scope bounded

Stops teams from “fixing” the wrong problem

This form of technical input often saves orders of magnitude more cost than it consumes.

Risk Allocation Clarification

Interpretation support does not transfer execution responsibility

Final design decisions remain with the licensee

Execution risk remains fully with the executing party

This support exists to inform decisions, not to own outcomes.

When This Support Is Most Valuable

This Phase 3 provision is particularly relevant:

Before internal design kickoff

Before proposal submission

Before major architectural commitments

Before early prototyping decisions

Once execution paths are locked, its value drops sharply.

Plain-English Summary

For large, high-risk projects like this one, the biggest danger isn’t building badly — it’s building the wrong thing. Phase 3 includes limited technical interpretation support to prevent concept drift before money is spent. This does not help build the system; it helps ensure the system being built still matches the original idea.
