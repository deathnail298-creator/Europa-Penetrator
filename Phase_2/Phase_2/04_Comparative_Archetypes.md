Comparative Archetypes
Purpose

This document places the concept within a set of reference archetypes to clarify what kind of system it actually is.

The goal is not to select an optimal approach.
The goal is to prevent category errors.

No execution guidance is provided.
No preference is implied.

Archetype Framing Rule

Each archetype represents a different philosophy of intervention.

Comparison focuses on:

Risk posture

Failure behavior

Institutional fit

Attention demand

Not performance or efficiency.

Archetype 1 — Active Mitigation Systems
Description

Systems that actively detect, respond to, or counteract a problem in real time.

Typical Characteristics

Sensors and feedback loops

Control logic or software

Performance-driven success metrics

Structural Tradeoffs

Higher effectiveness when working

Higher integration and certification burden

Failures are visible and often disruptive

Contrast Note

The Phase 2 concept explicitly avoids this archetype.
Adopting active mitigation logic would reclassify the system entirely.

Archetype 2 — Protective Hardening
Description

Systems that harden primary assets against environmental exposure.

Typical Characteristics

Robust materials and seals

Design-for-survivability

Degradation tolerance

Structural Tradeoffs

Predictable protection

Increased mass and cost

Protection is localized to the asset

Contrast Note

Hardening shifts cost and complexity into every protected system rather than externalizing it.

Archetype 3 — Operational Compensation
Description

Procedural or behavioral adaptations that work around a problem.

Typical Characteristics

Training and procedures

Increased maintenance

Operational awareness

Structural Tradeoffs

Low hardware cost

High human cost

Risk migrates into schedule and error

Contrast Note

This archetype dominates when infrastructure solutions are absent or unreliable.

Archetype 4 — Environmental Conditioning Infrastructure
Description

Passive systems that modestly alter the local environment rather than protecting specific assets.

Typical Characteristics

Always-on behavior

Marginal but cumulative effects

Low interaction requirement

Structural Tradeoffs

Benefits are probabilistic

Value accrues over time

Difficult to attribute success

Alignment Note

The Phase 2 concept resides primarily in this archetype.

Archetype 5 — Sacrificial or Disposable Assets
Description

Systems intended to absorb damage or degrade in place.

Typical Characteristics

Limited lifespan

Acceptable loss

Minimal maintenance

Structural Tradeoffs

Predictable failure

Replacement planning required

Debris or removal considerations

Contrast Note

Disposable framing can conflict with long-duration infrastructure assumptions.

Archetype 6 — Hybrid Systems
Description

Systems that combine elements from multiple archetypes.

Typical Characteristics

Partial actuation

Conditional attention

Mixed failure behavior

Structural Tradeoffs

Flexible capability

Complex certification

Ambiguous ownership

Caution Note

Hybridization often introduces the downsides of multiple archetypes without cleanly inheriting the benefits.

Misclassification Risks

The most common conceptual failures occur when a system is:

Evaluated as active mitigation when it is infrastructure

Expected to perform like hardening

Managed procedurally despite being passive

Certified as mission-critical despite being sacrificial

These mismatches generate friction independent of technical merit.

Phase Boundary Signal

If downstream reasoning requires the system to outperform its archetype, the framing is wrong.

Archetypes define expectations, not aspirations.

Plain-English Summary

This document compares the idea to different kinds of systems to clarify what it actually is. Problems arise when a system is judged by the wrong standards. Phase 2 uses archetypes to prevent those category mistakes before execution ever begins.
